                               <h3>Sports</h3>
                               <p> One of my most cherished pastimes involves engaging in basketball and hockey during my leisure hours, as they serve as effective stress relievers from my academic commitments. My passion for hockey has played a pivotal role in my life, leading me to become a dedicated volunteer for Hockey Heroes, an organization dedicated to providing underprivileged children with opportunities to participate in the sport. 
                                My involvement spans a decade, from my time in grade 5 to my current commitment of volunteering every Thursday. For additional information, please feel free to reach out to me or review my resume. </p>

                               <p> Working out is something new that I have enjoyed, as I feel that being motivated/dedicated to having a healthier body is important in one's life, as now I have goals for myself to achieve to not only to be healthier but to have some self-respect for myself. 
                                 Which is why I started enjoying working out on my freetime as it is a great way to be motivated to achieve something while also being relieved from stress. </p>

                               <p>Something about me is that I love to learn new things, which is why I love to make coding projects when I can to expand my horizon of coding. I feel that doing projects like this website not only illstrates who I am but it allows individuals to see what kind of person I am, as showing my personality and creativity throughout my projects can present more to others</p>
